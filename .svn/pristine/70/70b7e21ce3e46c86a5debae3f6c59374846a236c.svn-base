    <description>Backload is a professional, full featured server side file upload controller and handler for ASP.NET (MVC, Web API, ASP.NET WebForms). It handles the client side jQuery File Upload Plugin from blueimp, PlUpload from Moxiecode and Fine Uploader from Widen Enterprises out of the box, but it can be easily customized to work with any client side plugin (Example 09 on GitHub). More than 13 examples on GitHub. Cloud upload/manage feature (Release 2.0+). Continually developed and backed by the software industry.

This Release:
- NET 4.0 support added.
- Improved read/write access to storage locations at runtime.
- APTCA added to the assembly and compliance to the Security-Transparent Code (Level 2) rules.
- Added maxLength to the Images configuration. Images above this limit (bytes) will be stored directly with a generic thumbnail and are not handled in the image processing sub pipeline. 
- Added forceObjectContext attribute [true|false] (default: false) to the security configuration. If true, a client must send an objectContext with a request.
   
Bug fixes:
- Issue #21 resolved, where an exception occured while trying to read readonly files.
- Issue #20 resolved, where in some environments uploading very large files (&gt; 200MB) could cause an out of memory exception.
- Issue #17, #22, #23 resolved, where initialization of the component fails in some environments.
- Issue with urls resolved, where backload generates a wrong url if the application runs in a virtual or sub directory of web root.</releaseNotes>
